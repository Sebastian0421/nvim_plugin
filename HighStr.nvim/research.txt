How to highlight:


1. create hi groups
2. check which color is it
3. get visual selection
4. highlight it


In order to restore and store highlights the plugin must:
1. Create ~/.config/HighStr/tracker.txt if not exists
2. When `:HSSaveHighlight`, get full path (`expand('%:p')`) and append it to tracker.txt (or override it if it doesn't exist)
	2.i0 after that, put "= ~/.config/saved_highlights/hs_hi#.txt"
